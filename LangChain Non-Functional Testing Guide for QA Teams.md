### LangChain Non-Functional Testing Guide for QA Teams

### What is Non-Functional Testing?

Testing how well the system performs — speed, stability, and handling
heavy loads.

**Like testing:** Load testing a website — make sure it’s fast enough,
doesn’t crash under traffic, and handles errors gracefully.

### Why This Matters for QA

> **Prevents slow CI/CD** — Fast responses keep builds moving

> **Avoids system crashes** — Handle multiple requests without breaking

> **Stops pipeline outages** — Respect API limits to avoid getting
> blocked

### Test These 4 Performance Areas

**1. Streaming**

> **What:** Results flow in chunks, not all at once

> **Like testing:** Video streaming — content appears progressively, not
> after full download

> **Test:**

> Good: Get 2+ separate chunks during response

> Good: First chunk appears quickly (under 2 seconds)

> Bad: All text arrives in single chunk (not streaming)

> **Example:**

> Question: “Explain the test failure”

> Good streaming: “The test failed because…” then “…database timeout…”
> then “…retry recommended”

> Bad: \[wait 10 seconds\] then “The test failed because database
> timeout occurred and retry is recommended”

**2. Concurrency**

> **What:** Multiple requests handled at same time without conflicts

> **Like testing:** Multiple users on website — everyone gets correct
> data, no mixing

> **Test:**

> Good: 10 parallel requests all complete successfully

> Good: Each request gets its own correct result

> Bad: Requests interfere with each other or crash

> **Example:**

> Scenario: 5 users ask different questions simultaneously

> Good: User A gets answer about login tests, User B gets answer about
> API tests

> Bad: User A gets User B’s answer, or system crashes

**3. Rate Limits**

> **What:** System respects API usage limits and handles exceeded limits

> **Like testing:** Form submission limits — system blocks spam, allows
> normal use

> **Test:**

> Good: Under limit, requests go through normally

> Good: Over limit, system waits and retries

> Bad: Over limit, system crashes or ignores limits

> **Example:**

> API limit: 100 requests/minute

> Good: Request 99 succeeds

> Good: Request 101 waits 1 minute, then succeeds

> Bad: Request 101 crashes with “rate limit exceeded”

**4. Speed Requirements**

> **What:** Responses come back within acceptable time

> **Like testing:** Page load time — must be under X seconds for good
> user experience

**Test:**

> Good: Average response time under target (e.g., 500ms)

> Good: 50% of requests finish under budget (p50 latency)

> Bad: Responses consistently too slow

**Example:**

> Requirement: Test analysis under 500ms

> Good: 10 requests: 200ms, 300ms, 400ms, 350ms… (all under 500ms)

> Bad: 10 requests: 800ms, 900ms, 1200ms… (too slow)

### Real QA Examples

**CI/CD Status Bot**

> Setup: Bot reports build status in Slack

> Tests:

> Streams status updates progressively: “Checking…” then “Tests
> running…” then “Complete”

> 20 teams can check status simultaneously

> Respects Slack API rate limits (1 message/second)

> Status check completes in under 2 seconds

**Test Report Generator**

> Setup: Generates reports from test results

> Tests:

> Streams report sections as they’re ready

> Multiple reports can generate concurrently

> Backs off when database is busy

> Report generation under 5 seconds for standard test run

### Quick Testing Checklist

**Streaming Performance**

> Multiple chunks received during response

> First chunk appears quickly

> Total time reasonable for full response

**Concurrent Load**

> Multiple users can use system simultaneously

> No data mixing between requests

> System stable under parallel load

**Rate Limit Handling**

> System respects API limits

> Graceful backoff when limits exceeded

> Automatic retry after cooldown period

**Speed Requirements**

> Average response time meets target

> 50th percentile (p50) under budget

> No unacceptably slow responses

### Key Testing Rules

**1. Test realistic loads** — Use actual expected traffic patterns

**2. Measure consistently** — Same test conditions every time

**3. Set clear thresholds** — Define what “fast enough” means

**4. Test failure modes** — What happens when limits are exceeded

**5. Monitor over time** — Performance shouldn’t degrade with updates

### Common Problems to Catch

> **False streaming** — All data comes at once, just formatted in chunks

> **Race conditions** — Concurrent requests interfere with each other

> **Rate limit crashes** — System fails instead of waiting

> **Gradual slowdowns** — Performance degrades over time

> **Memory leaks** — System gets slower with each request

### Bottom Line

Non-functional testing ensures your LangChain system is
**production-ready**:

> Fast enough for real users and automated processes

> Stable enough to handle multiple requests reliably

> Smart enough to respect limits and handle failures

A system that works correctly but slowly or unreliably will frustrate
users and break automated workflows.
