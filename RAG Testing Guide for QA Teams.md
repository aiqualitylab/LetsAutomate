### RAG Testing Guide for QA Teams

### What is RAG?

Retrieval Augmented Generation — AI that looks up real documents before
answering questions.

**Like testing:** Search functionality + content verification — make
sure the AI finds the right info and uses it correctly in answers.

### Why This Matters for QA

> **Prevents made-up answers** — AI must use real data, not guess

> **Keeps reports accurate** — Test results cite actual logs, not
> fiction

> **Makes results repeatable** — Same question = same answer every time

### Test These 4 Components

### 1. Text Splitters

**What:** Break big documents into smaller chunks **Like testing:**
Pagination — make sure content doesn’t get cut off mid-sentence

**Test:**

- <span id="1055">✅ Chunk size = 500 chars → Actually gets ~500
  chars</span>
- <span id="867a">✅ Overlap = 50 chars → Next chunk starts 50 chars
  before end</span>
- <span id="9d4b">❌ Text cut mid-word → Should break at word
  boundaries</span>

**Example:**

``` graf
Document: "Test failed because database timeout occurred during login"
✅ Good split: "Test failed because database" | "database timeout occurred during login"  
❌ Bad split: "Test failed because databa" | "se timeout occurred during login"
```

### 2. Retrievers

**What:** Find relevant documents from your database **Like testing:**
Search filters — make sure you get exactly what you asked for

**Test:**

- <span id="adaf">✅ Ask for 5 results → Get exactly 5 results</span>
- <span id="05c9">✅ Filter by env=QA → Only QA environment logs
  returned</span>
- <span id="ee9c">✅ Same search twice → Same results both times</span>

**Example:**

``` graf
Query: "login failures in QA"
✅ Returns: 5 QA login test logs
❌ Returns: 3 QA logs + 2 production logs (filter broken)
```

### 3. End-to-End RAG

**What:** Complete question → search → answer flow **Like testing:**
Full user journey — search works AND results are used correctly

**Test:**

- <span id="19b5">✅ Answer mentions specific facts from retrieved
  docs</span>
- <span id="08c1">✅ Citations point to real source documents</span>
- <span id="4a68">❌ Answer includes info not in retrieved docs
  (hallucination)</span>

**Example:**

``` graf
Question: "Why did test #123 fail?"
Retrieved: "Test #123 failed: database connection timeout"
✅ Good answer: "Test #123 failed due to database connection timeout [source: test-log-456]"
❌ Bad answer: "Test #123 failed due to server overload" (made up reason)
```

### 4. Golden Datasets

**What:** Known good question/answer pairs for regression testing **Like
testing:** Smoke tests — core functionality that must always work

**Test:**

- <span id="2d36">✅ Same question → Same answer format every
  time</span>
- <span id="1a64">✅ Required facts always included in answer</span>
- <span id="3ee2">❌ Answer format changes unexpectedly</span>

**Example:**

``` graf
Golden test: "Show test coverage for login module"
Expected: Always includes percentage, file count, and timestamp
✅ "Login module: 85% coverage, 12 files, last run 2024-01-15"
❌ "Login coverage is mostly good" (missing specifics)
```

### Real QA Examples

### Test Failure Explanation Bot

**Setup:** Bot explains why tests failed by reading test logs

**Tests:**

- <span id="c29f">✅ Bot cites actual error from log file</span>
- <span id="386f">✅ Bot mentions correct test name and line
  number</span>
- <span id="7a2c">❌ Bot invents error details not in logs</span>

### CI/CD Report Generator

**Setup:** Generates reports from build logs and test results

**Tests:**

- <span id="7441">✅ Reports show exact failure counts from logs</span>
- <span id="7ff5">✅ Performance metrics match actual timing data</span>
- <span id="2fd1">❌ Reports include stats not found in source
  data</span>

### Knowledge Base Search

**Setup:** Finds relevant documentation for test questions

**Tests:**

- <span id="11e9">✅ Search for “API testing” returns API test
  docs</span>
- <span id="37bc">✅ Results filtered by team/project work
  correctly</span>
- <span id="75fa">❌ Irrelevant docs appear in results</span>

### Quick Testing Checklist

### Data Quality Checks

- <span id="c8b7">Text splits preserve meaning (no mid-word cuts)</span>
- <span id="25ae">Chunk sizes match configuration</span>
- <span id="af16">Overlaps maintain context between chunks</span>

### Search Accuracy

- <span id="38da">Filters work (environment, date, team, etc.)</span>
- <span id="342f">Result count matches request</span>
- <span id="1faf">Same search = same results</span>

### Answer Quality

- <span id="605c">Facts come from retrieved documents only</span>
- <span id="a753">Citations point to real sources</span>
- <span id="9be5">No made-up details or hallucinations</span>

### Regression Control

- <span id="ca0d">Golden tests pass consistently</span>
- <span id="7c8c">Answer format stays stable</span>
- <span id="c5be">Required information always included</span>

### Key Testing Rules

> **Verify sources** — Every fact should trace back to a real document

> **Test filters** — Make sure you get the right subset of data

> **Check consistency** — Same input should give same output

> **Prevent hallucinations** — AI can only use what it finds, not guess

> **Test edge cases** — Empty results, partial matches, corrupted data

### Common Problems to Catch

❌ **Silent hallucinations** — AI makes up plausible-sounding facts  
 ❌ **Filter failures** — Getting production data in QA reports  
 ❌ **Context loss** — Important details cut off during text splitting  
 ❌ **Inconsistent results** — Same question gives different answers  
 ❌ **Missing citations** — Can’t verify where information came from

### Bottom Line

RAG testing is about **trust and verification**:

> Trust that the AI finds the right information

> Verify that answers only use that information

> Ensure the process is repeatable and reliable

If you can’t trace an answer back to a source document, it’s a bug.
